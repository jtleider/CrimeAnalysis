This is some code I wrote to examine how violent crime varies by hour of the
day, based on Chicago crime data for the years 2009-2018
(https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).
Violent crime does appear to peak at night, as we might expect intuitively. The
peak seems to occur earlier in colder winter months and later in summer.
Interestingly, in many years there is a noticeable spike in January at 12 midnight,
which is entirely accounted for by New Year's Day. Otherwise, there are
generally not abrupt spikes at particular hours.
